# FIZZ BUZZ

Return an array containing the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the parametered value. N will never be less than 1 (in C#, N might be less than 1).

Replace certain values however if any of the following conditions are met:
<pre>
If the value is a multiple of 3: use the value 'Fizz' instead
If the value is a multiple of 5: use the value 'Buzz' instead
If the value is a multiple of 3 & 5: use the value 'FizzBuzz' instead
</pre>
